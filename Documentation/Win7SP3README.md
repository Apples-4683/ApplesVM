# 🍎 ApplesVM: The Windows 7 SP3 Project

This project is a dedicated effort to archive and document the Modernization of Windows 7 in 2026.
Any problems? Contact me on discord since I am a linux user and I am just visualizing how this update would look like. Discord link at the end of this document.

## Choose Your Architecture
Before you start, open **Control Panel > System and Security > System**. Check your "System type" carefully.

| Architecture | Guide Link | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **64-Bit (x86_64)** | [**Go to x64 Guide**](Documentation/Windows7SP3x64.md) | Modern VMs, Gaming, and 4GB+ RAM systems. |
| **32-Bit (x86)** | [**Go to x86 Guide**](Documentation/Windows7SP3x86.md) | Legacy hardware, Netbooks, and Vintage CPUs. Usually this. |

## DX11 Binaries
I only found the DX11 SDK so sorry, its 500MB.

## 🛠️ Project Goals
* **Connectivity:** Restoring modern web access via Supermium.
* **Compatibility:** Downloading the latest libraries that most apps require.
* **Security:** Bridging the update gap with LegacyUpdate.
* **Preservation:** Ensuring Windows 7 remains a viable "Semi-Modern" OS.
