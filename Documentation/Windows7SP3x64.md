Hello! Glad your here. No matter why or when you here, just to make a VM or revive a machine, lets just go.
This is the documentation for x86_64 machines.
To start off, open control panel and check about system. If it says 64 Bit computer, youre fine, if it says its 32 bit, it might be lying because it might be just a 32 Bit Windows copy but that usually dosen't happen.
If it says 32 Bit then refer to Windows7SP3x86.md.
Do you have an Ultimate, Enterprise or other version of Windows 7 ? Do you have Service Pack 1 or no service pack. If other version of windows without service pack then it's recommended but optional that you install Ultimate or Enterprise for most features, and server if you want a more vintage feel but not recommended.
[OPTIONAL]
Dont have a cd of Ultimate or Enterprise with Service Pack? Use Supermium at https://win32subsystem.live/supermium/ or https://win32subsystem.live/supermium/?legacy=true if that dosent work.
You can open this on the Windows 7 machine since its IE (internet explorer) friendly and download the 64 bit version of Supermium setup (IMPORTANT!). Now that you've installed Supermium, go to archive.org and find a copy of Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64 iso and download it.
Once downloaded, double click it from Windows Explorer and it'll be mounted. Click on the Windows 7 CD-ROM drive and double click setup.exe and follow the instructions. 
[END OF OPTIONAL]
To get lots of updates for Windows 7 that make it feel supported again, go to https://legacyupdate.net. This is REQUIRED for most things done here and outside here.
Install Supermium again if not installed and go to https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist and while your at it, https://github.com/YuZhouRen86/VxKex-NEXT/releases/latest for Windows version spoofing. The first link is the all in one script for Visual Studio Runtimes that most games require.
Now go to my Github repository at https://github.com/Apples-4683/ApplesVM and go to the tag DX11 and download the exe binary.
When installed, run it and follow the instructions.
BOOM! YOU SUCCESSFULLY HAVE A SEMI-MODERN 64 BIT WINDOWS 7 MACHINE!
