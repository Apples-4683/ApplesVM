Hello and welcome to the x86 guide for the Winodws 7 SP3 project ! You probably came here because the control panel said 32 bit and if you didnt check it, do it.
Anyways this is mostly the same.
Check what is your Windows 7 version. Is it Ultimate , Enterprise or other? Does it have a Service pack? If other without a service pack or similar, then its recommended you install Windows 7 Ultimate 32 Bit SP1.
[OPTIONAL]
Install Supermium for 32 Bit at https://win32subsystem.live/supermium/ or https://win32subsystem.live/supermium/?legacy=true. IT MUST BE 32 BIT. Then go to archive.org and search for Windows 7 Ultimate 32 Bit SP1 iso.
Once installed, double click the iso from Windows Explorer and it'll be mounted.
Click on the virtual DVD driver, run setup.exe and follow the instructions.
[END OF OPTIONAL]
Now install supermium if you haven't yet and go to https://legacyupdate.net to install legacy update.
What does it do? It installs updates for Windows 7 which is essential for security.
After that install VS runtimes at https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist and https://github.com/YuZhouRen86/VxKex-NEXT/releases/latest for Windows version spoofing using Supermium.
You should install DirectX11 for this at the tag DX11 in this repository.
BOOM! YOU SHOULD HAVE A SEMI MODERN WINDOWS 7 MACHINE!
